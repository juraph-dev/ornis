/**
 * @brief The StringTreeLeaf is, as the name suggests, a leaf (terminal node)
 * of a StringTree.
 * It provides the pointer to the node and a list of numbers that represent
 * the index that corresponds to the placeholder "#".
 *
 * For example if you want to represent the string
 *
 *      foo/2/bar/3/hello/world
 *
 * This would correspond to a branch of the tree (from root to the leaf) equal to these 6 nodes,
 * where "foo" is the root and "world" is the leaf
 *
 * foo -> # -> bar -> # ->hello -> world
 *
 * array_size will be equal to two and index_array will contain these numbers {2,3}
 *
