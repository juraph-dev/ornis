# Project Name

A simple template I plan on using for all of my C++14 projects.

Making cross platform C++ projects is widely known to be a troublesome ambition. This project attempts to demystify many of the common problems related to creating such a structure by providing a simple template that achieves this purpose.

This documentation is divided into the following sections:
- \subpage variables_and_targets
- \subpage directory_structure
- \subpage setting_up_ci
- \subpage setting_up_documentation
